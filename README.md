# hpoutil

This code repo is now a prototype version of a nosology-driven ruled-based inference engine for
the HPO that is using the skeletal nosology as an example.
To test it, first compile the code

 $ mvn package

Then run the code with the script runHPOUtil.sh. Note that you will need to adjust the paths

  $ ./runHPOUtil.sh 

This will produce an output file called  skelnos-inference.txt
